1. Start a lab recording session.

    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

2. Supply your username in the terminal

3. Click continue after the environment starts: All lab activity should be done inside the environment. This is necessary for checking.

      ```examiner:execute-test
      name: envcheck.sh
      title: Verify that lab environment is running
      retries: .INF
      delay: 1
      autostart: true
      ```
