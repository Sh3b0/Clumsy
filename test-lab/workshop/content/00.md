1. Supply your username to start a lab recording session.

    ```examiner:execute-test
    name: start.sh
    prefix: Task
    title: Start lab
    inputs:
      schema:
          name:
            type: string
            title: "Username:"
            default: "student"
            required: true
      form:
      - "*"
      - type: submit
        title: Start
    ```

2. Click continue after the environment starts.
   - All lab activity should be done inside the environment. This is necessary for checking.

  ```examiner:execute-test
  name: envcheck.sh
  title: Verify that lab environment is running
  retries: .INF
  delay: 1
  autostart: true
  ```
