This is the dashboard for the Educates workshop environment. If you are seeing this it is because the workshop dashboard base image has been deployed without any custom workshop content, and the default content for testing the dashboard is being used.

The purpose of the default content is to test web browser compatibility with the workshop environment.

Go through the workshop and perform the steps described to check that a browser will work with the workshop environment.

The recommended web browsers are Chrome and Firefox. Ensure you are using an up to date version of the web browser.
