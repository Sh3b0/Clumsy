Including images in content can help to explain a concept more quickly than using words alone. When content is viewed in the dashboard, it is in a narrow column to the left, which can make it hard to read. One can though click on images to create a popup which will allow a wider image to expand  out to fill more of the screen. Click on each of the images below to check that the popup covers the full screen, including overlapping the terminal area.
