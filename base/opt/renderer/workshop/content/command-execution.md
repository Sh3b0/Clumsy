Workshop content can contain commands which need to be run in one of the terminals. These commands are shown as a code block with the symbol of a running person <span class="fas fa-running"></span> appearing to the right hand side.

If a number appears after the symbol it indicates which of the terminal windows the command will be run. If no number is shown, the first terminal is used. Where a workshop uses multiple terminals, you therefore don't need to determine which terminal the command should be run in, the workshop content will make this choice for you.

```execute-1
echo 'Run in the upper terminal'
```

Click anywhere on the highlighted code block above. When this is done, the command should be copied to the first terminal and run. The colour of the symbol should also change indicating you had clicked on it.

There is therefore no need to type the commands in yourself. If you want, you can select a terminal and type in your own commands, but it is recommended that for the commands that the workshop specifies should be run, that you click on it to have it run for you and so avoid any mistakes. It will also save you lots of time.

Click now on the command below and it should be run in the second terminal instead of the first terminal.

```execute-2
echo 'Run in the lower terminal'
```
