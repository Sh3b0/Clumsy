title: Time Zone

- Check the current time zone

  ```execute
  timedatectl
  ```

  You should get output similar to the following:

  ```
  Local time: Sun 2024-03-10 21:37:11 EET
             Universal time: Sun 2024-03-10 19:37:11 UTC
                   RTC time: Sun 2024-03-10 21:37:10
                  Time zone: Africa/Cairo (EET, +0200)
  System clock synchronized: yes
                NTP service: active
            RTC in local TZ: yes
  ```

- Assume that we are somewhere else and we want to change the timezone to (GMT +10). To do this, first get a list of all available time zones.

  ```execute
  timedatectl list-timezones
  ```

  You will find the full name for the time zone in the long list of output.

- Now that we have identified the name of the time zone on our system, switch to that with the following command:

  ```execute
  sudo timedatectl set-timezone Continent/Country
  ```

- Run `timedatectl` and you should get output different from what we had initially.

- You can manually change the time zone with a symlink. The symlink at `/etc/localtime` points to the time zone that is currently configured.

  ```execute
  ls -l /etc/localtime
  ```

- Remove the symlink

  ```execute
  sudo rm -rf /etc/localtime
  ```

- Letâ€™s change time zone to Moscow time. To do this, create a new symlink to the Moscow time `Europe/Moscow` in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`

  ```execute
  sudo ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Moscow /etc/localtime
  ```

- Check the time zone again.

  ```execute
  timedatectl
  ```
