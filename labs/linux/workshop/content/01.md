---

- Check the distribution of Linux you are using

  ```execute
  cat /etc/os-release
  ```

- Check the username of the user who is currently logged on to the local system

  ```execute
  whoami
  ```

- Print the absolute path to your working directory

  ```execute
  pwd
  ```

- List the content of your current directory

  ```execute
  ls -lah
  ```

- Navigate to the root directory

  ```execute
  cd /
  ```

- List content. Common entries you may see include:

  - /bin : binaries (e.g., ls , cp , ...)
  - /boot : static files for boot loader.
  - /dev : contains files for external devices attached to the system, (USBs, display, keyboard) as
  well as /dev/null
  - /etc : config files local to the machine.
  - /home : contains a subfolder for each normal (non-system) user with their name, containing
  user desktop files, documents, etc.
  - /lib : software libraries shared by programs (e.g., ld* , lib , *.so.* )
  - /media : mounted file systems of removable media (e.g., flash memory)
  - /mnt : temporarily mounted file systems (user can mount FSs there)
  - /proc : contains information about running processes, their memory and CPU utilization.
  - /root : home directory for root, hidden from user, contains system files.
  - /var : dynamic files; constantly being written to or changed (websites are typically stored
  there)
  - /srv site-specific data served by the file system.
  - /sbin binaries used by root (e.g., fsck )
  - /tmp temporary files, cleaned regularly on boot or by a job
  - /usr contains user application, typically stored under /usr/local
  - /opt intended for optional application addons.

- View all shells installed on the machine

  > A shell is a program that provides an interface for the user to interact with the operating system. It gathers input (commands) from the user, executes them, and return the output when necessary. The terminal where you type your command is a shell.

  ```execute
  cat /etc/shells
  ```

- View the shell you are currently using

  ```execute
  echo "$SHELL"
  ```

- Get help about a command

  ```execute
  man ls     # Manual pages (manpages)
  ```

- Alternatives
  ```
  ls -h      # Passing --help flag 
  tldr ls    # Short help (needs to be installed)
  ```
