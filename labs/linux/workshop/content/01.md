- Check the username of the user who is currently logged on to the local system

  ```execute
  whoami
  ```

- View all currently logged in users

  ```execute
  users
  ```

- View the content of your current working directory

  ```execute
  pwd
  ```

- List the content of your current directory

  ```execute
  ls -lah
  ```

  > - 1st bit can be `d` for directory, `-` for file, `s` for socket `p` for pipe, `D` for Door, `l` for symlinks, `c` for character special files.
  > - 1st triple: owner permissions, 2nd: group, 3rd: everyone.
  > - Numerical representation: `1=x, 2=w, 4=r`, thus: `3=-wx, 5=r-x, 6=rw-, 7=rwx` which can be used with `chmod` alternative to `chmod +|-` syntax.

- Navigate to another directory

  ```execute
  cd ~/Downloads
  ```

- Check your current working directory again.

- View all shells installed on the machine

  > A shell is a program that provides an interface for the user to interact with the operating system. It gathers input (commands) from the user, executes them, and return the output when necessary. The terminal where you type your command is a shell.

  ```execute
  cat /etc/shells
  ```

- View the shell you are currently using

  ```execute
  echo "$SHELL"
  ```

- Check the manual for any command using `man`. Example:

  ```execute
  man ls
  ```
