title: Remote Repositories – Collaborating with the World
---

Until now, you’ve worked with Git **locally**, on your own machine. But Git becomes even more powerful when you **connect it to a remote repository**—like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

> A remote repository is a shared version of your project stored online so you (and your team) can work from anywhere.

---

### Step 1: Check for a Remote

Let’s check if your Git project is already linked to a remote:

```execute
git remote -v
```

If you see nothing, your project is still local-only. That’s fine — we’ll add a remote soon.

---

### Step 2: Add a Remote Repository

Let’s say you’ve created a repo on GitHub at:

```
https://github.com/<<yourusername>>/catgram.git
```

You can connect your local project to it:

```copy-and-edit
git remote add origin https://ghp_my_personal_token@github.com/<<yourusername>>/catgram.git
```

Now `origin` is your remote repo's nickname.

```
You might need to setup classic tokens to authenticate to Github via the terminal. 
Navigate to your Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens -> Tokens (classic) -> Generate new token (classic)

Finally, after authorizing using your password, input a text in the Note field, configure the expiration date and define the scope of access for your personal token.
Generate your personal token by clicking the Green Button (Generate token) at the buttom of the page. 
```
---

### Step 3: Push to the Remote

To upload your local code to the remote repository:

```execute
git push -u origin main
```

> `-u` sets up tracking, so in the future you can just run `git push`.

---

### Step 4: Pull Remote Changes

To get updates from your team or other contributors:

```execute
git pull
```

This fetches and merges changes from the remote into your local copy.

---

### Bonus: Cloning a Repo

If you're starting fresh and want to grab a remote repo:

```execute
git clone https://github.com/<<yourusername>>/catgram.git
```

This downloads the entire project, history included.

---

### Recap

* Remote repositories let you **collaborate and back up** your work online.
* Use `git push` to upload changes and `git pull` to fetch updates.
* GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are all great Git hosting services.

> Coming up: we’ll practice a full **Git workflow**—from branching to merging to pushing—just like real teams do.
