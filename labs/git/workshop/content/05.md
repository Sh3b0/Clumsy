title: Viewing Changes and Commit History
---

Now that you've made your first commit, let’s explore how Git helps you **track what changed, when, and why**—an essential skill for any developer.

---

### Checking Your Project's History

The most basic way to review your commit history is with:

```execute
git log
```

This shows a list of commits, each with:

* A unique SHA (commit ID)
* Author
* Date
* Commit message

If the list is too long, you can exit the log by pressing `q`.

---

### Making a Change

Let’s modify your homepage by adding a line.

```execute
echo "<p>Share your cutest cat pics with friends</p>" >> index.html
```

Now check what’s changed since your last commit:

```execute
git status
```

You’ll see that `index.html` has been **modified**.

To see exactly *what* changed, run:

```execute
git diff
```

This shows the line(s) added or removed:

```
+<p>Share your cutest cat pics with friends!</p>
```

---

### Staging and Committing the Change

Once you're happy with the changes:
Add the changes to the staging area

```execute
git add index.html
```
and commit
```execute
git commit -m "Add welcome message to homepage"
```

Run `git log` again to view the new commit.

---

### Viewing Specific Changes

If you want to view the **difference between commits**, use:

```execute
git log --oneline
```

This shows a short version of the history, like:

```
d9a8e1f Add welcome message to homepage  
abc1234 Add homepage for Catgram
```

To compare the two:

```copy-and-edit
git diff abc1234 d9a8e1f
```

You’ll see the changes between those two snapshots.

---

### Tip: Use `git show` for Quick Insight

To view what a specific commit did:

```copy-and-edit
git show d9a8e1f
```

This reveals both the commit message and the exact changes.

---

### Recap

* `git log` shows your history
* `git diff` reveals changes
* `git show` inspects a commit
* You now understand how to *see what happened and when*

> Understanding your project's history makes debugging, collaborating, and reviewing code much easier.
