title: Making Your First Commit
---

Now that your Git project is initialized and ready, it‚Äôs time to track your work with a **commit**‚Äîa snapshot of your code at a point in time.

Let‚Äôs create a simple HTML file for your cat photo-sharing website:

```execute
echo "<h1>Welcome to Catgram üê±</h1>" > index.html
```

Check the status of your Git repository:

```execute
git status
```

You should see:

```
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	index.html
```

This tells you that `index.html` exists but Git isn‚Äôt tracking it yet.

### Stage the File

Before committing, you must **stage** the file. Staging means preparing the file to be included in the next commit.

```execute
git add index.html
```

Now run `git status` again:

```execute
git status
```

You‚Äôll see:

```
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   index.html
```

### Make the Commit

Now that the file is staged, let‚Äôs make your first commit:

```execute
git commit -m "Add homepage for Catgram"
```

The `-m` flag lets you write a short message describing the change.

You‚Äôll see an output like:

```
[main (root-commit) abc1234] Add homepage for Catgram
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html
```

Git has now recorded a snapshot of your project with a unique commit ID (SHA).

You can view your commit history like this:

```execute
git log
```

You should see:

```
commit abc1234 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Your Name <educates-cli-w01-s001@git.educates.dev>
Date:   Mon Jul 8 12:34:56 2025 +0000

    Add homepage for Catgram
```
---
### Recap

* You created a file (`index.html`)
* You staged it with `git add`
* You committed it with `git commit`

> Commits are the heart of version control. You can always roll back to them or see who changed what, when, and why.

In the next module, you‚Äôll make more changes and learn how to view and manage the differences between commits using `git diff` and `git log`.
