title: Branching – Working in Parallel
---

Git makes it easy to **branch out**, work on a new feature, and then **merge** your work back into the main code once it’s ready—all without breaking anything.

> Think of a branch as a copy of your project where you can experiment safely.

---

### Step 1: Check the Current Branch

You’re likely on the `main` branch right now:

```execute
git branch
```

---

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Let’s create a branch for your new feature:

```execute
git branch add-photo-upload
```

To switch to it:

```execute
git checkout add-photo-upload
```

Or do both in one go:

```execute
git checkout -b add-photo-upload
```

---

### Step 3: Work and Commit in the New Branch

Make some changes (e.g., edit a file), then commit:

```execute
git add .
git commit -m "Add photo upload feature"
```

You’re now building your feature independently from the main code!

---

### Step 4: Merge Back to Main

Once you're happy with your changes, switch back to `main`:

```execute
git checkout main
```

Then merge your branch:

```execute
git merge add-photo-upload
```

If everything went smoothly, your new feature is now part of the main project.

---

### Step 5: Delete the Feature Branch (Optional)

To keep things clean:

```execute
git branch -d add-photo-upload
```

---

### Quick Tips

* Use branches to isolate features, bug fixes, or experiments.
* Keep branch names descriptive (`fix-login-bug`, `feature/comments`, etc.).
* Never work directly on `main` for large changes—**branch first**!
