When the embedded Git server is enabled, you can directly use it. Let's clone
an empty project:

```bash
git clone $GIT_PROTOCOL://$GIT_HOST/project.git
```

Now that we have cloned that empty project, let's add some files to it:

```bash
cd project
```

Let's create some text file:

```bash
date > date.txt
```

Now, we will add the file to our project:

```bash
git add .
```

Let's commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial files."
```

And push them to our repository:

```bash
git push
```

You will notice in the output the full url of your repository. This can be accessed
externally if desired.
