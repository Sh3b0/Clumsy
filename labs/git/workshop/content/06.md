title: Branching in Git – Experiment Without Breaking Things
---

Imagine you want to add a new feature to your cat photo site—like a “Like” button—but you don’t want to mess up the current working version. **Branches** let you do exactly that.

> Think of a branch as a parallel universe where you can make changes safely and later decide if you want to bring them back into the main project.

---

### Create a New Branch

Let’s create a new branch called `like-feature`:

```execute
git branch like-feature
```

You now have two branches:

* `main` (your default)
* `like-feature` (your new one)

To **switch to the new branch**:

```execute
git checkout like-feature
```

You’re now working in your own sandbox!

---

### Make Changes on the New Branch

Add a like button to your homepage:

```execute
echo "<button>Like</button>" >> index.html
```

Then stage and commit:

```execute
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add like button"
```

---

### View Your Branches

To list all branches:

```execute
git branch
```

The `*` shows your current branch.

---

### Switch Between Branches

Let’s switch back to `main`:

```execute
git checkout main
```

Open `index.html`—you’ll see there’s **no like button** here. The change exists only in `like-feature`.
```execute
cat index.html
```

To go back to your feature work:

```execute
git checkout like-feature
```

---

### Why Branching Matters

Branches let you:

* Try new features
* Fix bugs without disturbing the main code
* Work on multiple ideas in parallel
* Collaborate more safely

---

### Bonus Tip

Want to create and switch in one step?

```copy-and-edit
git checkout -b another-feature
```

---

### Recap

* `git branch` creates a branch
* `git checkout` switches branches
* Branches are your best friend for safe experimentation

> In the next module, you’ll learn how to **merge branches**, so you can bring your awesome changes back to `main`.
