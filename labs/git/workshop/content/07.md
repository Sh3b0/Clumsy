title: Merging Branches – Bringing It All Together
---

You’ve created a new feature in a branch called `like-feature`. Now it’s time to **bring that work back into your main project**. This is called a **merge**.

> Think of merging as combining your experimental changes with the main project after you're satisfied they work.

---

### Step 1: Switch Back to the `main` Branch

We want to bring changes **into** `main`, so first switch to it:

```execute
git checkout main
```

---

### Step 2: Merge the Feature Branch

Now merge your `like-feature` branch into `main`:

```execute
git merge like-feature
```

You should see output like:

```
Updating a3c9f41..b7f9d7b
Fast-forward
 index.html | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Congratulations! The like button is now part of the `main` project.

---

### Optional: Delete the Feature Branch

Once a branch is merged and no longer needed, you can delete it to keep things tidy:

```execute
git branch -d like-feature
```

Don’t worry—this doesn’t delete your code. Your changes are already merged into `main`.

---

### What If There’s a Conflict?

Sometimes, Git can’t automatically merge if the same part of a file was changed in both branches. This is called a **merge conflict**.

Git will pause the merge and ask you to **manually fix** the conflict. You’ll see `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` in the file to help you decide which version to keep.

After resolving it:

```execute
git add index.html
```

```execute
git commit
```

You’re back on track!

### Recap

* Merging integrates changes from one branch into another
* `git merge branch-name` brings changes into the current branch
* Conflicts may occur, but Git helps you fix them step by step
