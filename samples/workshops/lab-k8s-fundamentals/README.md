Lab - Kubernetes Fundamentals
=============================

This repository holds source files for a workshop on Kubernetes fundamentals.

This workshop borrows heavily from a similar
[workshop](https://github.com/openshift-labs/lab-k8s-fundamentals) by the same
author (Graham Dumpleton) which was developed while working for Red Hat. The
current workshop is a refactoring of the prior workshop to use Educates 2.X.
This workshop and the original workshop are both made available under the terms
of the Apache License, Version 2.0.
