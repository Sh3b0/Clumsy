title: Workshop Overview
---

The Educates training platform is a Kubernetes native application which provides
time limited sandboxes for hosted workshop environments.

This series of workshops demonstrates the capabilities of the Educates training
platform and how it can be used.

In this workshop you will get an overview of how to add additional extension packages
to your workshop. These extension packages can provide additional binaries (like CLIs)
or VS Code extensions.

You can find some available extensions at the [Educates Hub](https://hub.educates.dev/?type=ExtensionPackage)
