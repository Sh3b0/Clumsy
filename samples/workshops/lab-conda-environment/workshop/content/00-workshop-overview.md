The Educates training platform is a Kubernetes native application which provides
time limited sandboxes for hosted workshop environments.

This series of workshops demonstrates the capabilities of the Educates training
platform and how it can be used.

In this workshop you will get an overview of how to do workshops based on 
Conda's Python in case your workshop is for anything data science related.
