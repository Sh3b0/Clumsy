title: Workshop Overview - What is Git?
---

Imagine you're a new software developer at a company building avionics software for commercial airliners. Quality control is essential, and small teams use Git for version control. While you've heard of Git, you've never used it and are eager to learn.

To get started, you decide to build a fun side project—a website for sharing cat photos with friends—using Git to track changes and back up code. But before jumping in, you need to understand the basics.

This workshop introduces version control and Git. Though Git may seem cryptic or frustrating at first, learning it step by step will reveal why it’s become the world’s leading version control system—for developers and collaborative teams alike.

Git is a so-called distributed version control system. It helps developers work on the same source code, without creating problems like code conflicts caused by contradicting changes. Git makes it easy for everyone to see who modified some code, when, and why. 

> With Git, you can see what others are working on, review their code, view your previous changes, roll back to previous code, and do much more.
