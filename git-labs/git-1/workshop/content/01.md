**Version Control System (VCS)**
A tool that helps you track changes in your code over time. Think of it as a “save history” for your project that lets multiple people work together without overwriting each other’s work.

**Commit**
A snapshot of your changes. Like hitting “save” in a video game—you can always come back to it. Each commit records what changed and why.

**Push**
Sends your saved work (commits) from your computer to the shared online repository so others can see it. It’s like uploading photos to the cloud.

**Pull**
Grabs the latest changes from the shared repository and applies them to your local project. Like syncing your phone with the latest cloud backup.

**SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)**
A unique ID (like a fingerprint) for each commit. It ensures every version of your project can be precisely identified and verified.

**Branch**
A separate line of work within your project. Imagine copying your document to test a new idea—branches let you do that safely, without touching the main version.

Almost every company is now powered by software in one way or another. There are multiple projects handled by many developers in an organization, and they all need a means to track, upload, and receive changes to the code base. Effective repository management services are the key to fast and efficient software development.
