title: Get to know your server

## INTRO

You should now have a remote server setup running the latest Ubuntu Server LTS (Long Term Support) version. You alone will be administering it. To become a fully-rounded Linux server admin you should become comfortable working with different versions of Linux, but for now Ubuntu is a good choice.

Once you have reached a level of comfort at the command-line then you'll find your skills transfer not only to all the standard Linux variants, but also to Android, Apple's OSX, OpenBSD, Solaris and IBM AIX. Throughout the course you'll be working on Linux - but in fact most of what is covered is applicable to any system derived from the [UNIX Operating System](https://youtu.be/tc4ROCJYbm0) - and the major differences between them are with their graphic user interfaces such as Gnome, Unity, KDE etc - none of which youâ€™ll be using!

## YOUR TASK TODAY

* Run a few simple commands to check the status of your server - like [this demo](https://asciinema.org/a/619479)

## LOGIN TO YOUR SERVER

Once logged in, notice that the "command prompt" that you receive ends in `$` - this is the convention for an ordinary user, whereas the "root" user with full administrative power has a `#` prompt (but we will dive into this difference in Day 3 as well).

Here's a [short vid on using ssh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMMOUSRPfJc) in a work environment.

## GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SERVER

Use `lsb_release -a` to see which Linux distro and version you're using. [lsb_release](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/lsbrelease.html) may not be available in your server, as it's not widely adopted, but you will always have the same information available in the system file [os-release](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/os-release.5.html). You can check its content by typing `cat /etc/os-release`

`uname -a` will also print the [system information](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uname.1.html) and it can show some interesting things like kernel version, hardware platform, etc.

`uptime` will show you [how long the system has been running](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uptime.1.html). It kinda makes the [weird numbers](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/753868/proc-uptime-command-gives-weird-result) you get from `cat /proc/uptime` a lot more readable.

`whoami` will print the [user name](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/whoami.1.html) you logged on with, `who` will show [who is logged on](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/who.1.html) and `w` will also show [what they are doing](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/w.1.html).

## HARDWARE INFORMATION

`lshw` can give some [detailed information on the hardware configuration](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/lshw.1.html), and there's a bunch of switches we can use to filter the information we want to see, but it's not the only tool we use to check hardware with. Some of the used commands are:

* `lscpu` to display information about the [CPU architecture](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lscpu.1.html)
* `lsblk` to list [block devices](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsblk.8.html)
* `lspci` to list all [PCI devices](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lspci.8.html)
* `lsusb` to list [USB devices](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsusb.8.html)

## MEASURE MEMORY AND CPU USAGE

Don't worry! Linux [won't eat your RAM](https://linuxatemyram.com/). But if you want to check the amount of [memory used](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/free.1.html) in the system, use `free -h` . `vmstat` will also give some [memory statistics](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/vmstat.8.html).

`top` is like a [Task Manager](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html) for Linux, it will display the processes and the consumption of resources. `htop` is an [interactive](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/htop.1.html), prettier version.

## MEASURE DISK USAGE

Use `df -h` to see [disk space](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/df.1.html) usage, but go with `du -h` if you want to estimate the [size](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/du.1.html) of your folders.

## MEASURE NETWORK USAGE

You will have a general idea of your network interfaces and their IP addresses by using `ifconfig` or its modern substitute `ip address`, but it won't show you bandwidth usage.

For that we have `netstat -i` in a more [static view](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/netstat.8.html) and `ifstat` in a [continuous view](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ifstat.8.html). To interrupt `ifstat` just use `CTRL+C`.

But if you want more info on that traffic, `sudo iftop -i eth0` is a [nice display](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/iftop.8.html). *Change `eth0` for the interface you wish to capture traffic information.* To exit the monitor view, type `q` to quit.

## POSTING YOUR PROGRESS

Regularly posting your progress can be a helpful motivator. Feel free to post to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/)/[community](https://programming.dev/c/linuxupskillchallenge) or to the [discord chat](https://discord.gg/linux-upskill-challenge-682046666928685068) a small introduction of yourself, and your Linux background for your "classmates" - and notes on how each day has gone.

Of course, also drop in a note if you get stuck or spot errors in these notes.

## EXTENSION
